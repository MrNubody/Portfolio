# Portfolio
This repository showcases my learning progress and projects as I explore software development and programming in general . As I build my skills, I’m working on small projects, coding exercises, and experiments to apply what I learn in practical ways.

** Projects in Python:
Developed small-scale programs including guessing games, basic calculators, and string manipulation tools.
Implemented fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and error handling.
Gained hands-on experience with Python’s built-in modules (random, time, sys) for interactive applications.
Practiced working with user input, data validation, and basic list and string operations.
